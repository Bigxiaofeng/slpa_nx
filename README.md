Community mining with Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) for networkx graphs.

This is the python/networkx implementation of the community mining algorithm presented in this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.5720
The algorithm has a linear complexity and can find overlapping communities.
